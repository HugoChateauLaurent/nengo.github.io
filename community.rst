For general discussion of the :ref:`Nengo ecosystem`,
we host a `Forum <http://forum.nengo.ai>`_. 

Every year we help run a :ref:`Summer School <Nengo summer school>` which allows people to build projects using Nengo.

Not surprisingly, a large :ref:`team <People>` is responsible for the current state of Nengo.

Finally, Nengo is the backbone to a series of tutorials in the book :ref:`How to Build a Brain`.
